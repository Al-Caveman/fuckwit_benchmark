# This Bencharks The Fuckwit (KPTI)
These workloads are benchmarked:

  - web benchark 3.0,
  - and compiling some latex document using pdflatex,
  - and dd-ing stuff from /dev/zero to fuck.
    
All workloads are repeated 2 to 3 times. Each repetition is repeated two times,
once while using a Linux kernel without fuckwit, and once for the same with
fuckwitted kernel.

# Notes
I am emotionally not maximally satisfied that Linus Torvalds adopted KPTI
instead of Fuckwit. But my brain tells me that PKTI is a more accurate name
with less redundancies.  However, I think, part of the advantages of Fuckwit is
that it delivers an insult to Intel, which is deserves.

Here is my 2018 edition of George Carlin's cheer:

> Batshit fuckwit dirty old twad.
> x86 assholes tied to a knot.
> Hooray, Intelshit, fuck!
