# This Bencharks The Fuckwit
These workloads are benchmarked:

    - web benchark 3.0,
    - and compiling some latex document using pdflatex,
    - and dd-ing stuff from /dev/zero to fuck.
    
All workloads are repeated 2 to 3 times. Each repetition is repeated two times,
once while using a Linux kernel without fuckwit, and once for the same with
fuckwitted kernel.
